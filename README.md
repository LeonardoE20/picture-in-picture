A friend of mine wanted to have a screen that can record another window, that way he is able to react to whatever he is watching within that screen with a friend. So I decided to create an application that does that. This program allows you to open any screen, application, or tab in a movable resizable, window that will stay and follow you on top of anything you do. An example could be where you are watching a tutorial video in the corner of your laptop screen while you are working on something in the background.

## Instructions
**This works best in Chrome on the desktop**
1. When you either click on the link that takes you to the webpage or load the page, it will give you choices to what screen you would want to share. You can select any screen, application, or browser tab you want to share.
2. When you choose your selection, click "Start" to begin the program and have fun!
